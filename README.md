WEED & HEMP on Algorand: Project Overview & Roadmap

This repository relates to the WEED & HEMP token project, a dual-token initiative launched on the Algorand blockchain.

Vision

Our vision is to foster an inclusive, global community built on respect for cannabis culture, education, and harm reduction. We aim to unify diverse perspectives through our unique dual-token model (WEED for recreation, HEMP for wellness), leveraging the speed, security, and sustainability of the Algorand blockchain. We prioritize community well-being and shared understanding over purely speculative metrics, aiming to cultivate a dedicated core group and grow organically.


Guiding Principles

Community First: Building an inclusive, supportive, and engaged community.

Unity & Respect: Using the dual-token model to bridge perspectives.

Transparency: Open communication about progress, decisions, and tokenomics.

Education & Harm Reduction: Integrating educational content and promoting informed choices.

Utility Driven: Developing meaningful token utility (NFTs, gated access, potential DeFi/staking).

Algorand Alignment: Utilizing Algorand features effectively and highlighting its advantages (speed, low fees, security, eco-friendly).


3-Year Roadmap Summary

Our strategic direction focuses on sustainable growth and community empowerment:

Phase 1: Launch & Foundation (Year 1)

Focus: Fair launch (via rug.ninja), establishing core community channels, attracting the initial tribe (420+ holders), providing initial DEX liquidity (accessible via Vestige.fi), finalizing token parameters for trust (disabling freeze/clawback), and developing NFT utility concepts.

Phase 2: Growth & Utility (Year 2)

Focus: Organic community expansion, launching the first NFT collection & swap mechanism, implementing token-gated access, building Algorand ecosystem partnerships, increasing DEX visibility, and exploring governance & potential staking/DeFi participation.

Phase 3: Maturity & Expansion (Year 3)

Focus: Implementing community governance, expanding utility based on community decisions, achieving ecosystem recognition, ensuring long-term sustainability, and exploring broader impact/integration.
